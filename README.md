### Notes

Binaries of demos I wrote between 1995 and 1998, saved thanks to scene.org.

You can run everything today in DosBox.

#### Obez (1995)

64kb intro with real-time software phong rendering.

The sound is buggy for historical reasons (notes with pitch too high are peaked to a lower pitch, and tempo sync is broken), but I will attempt to fix this.

#### Nikki (1996-1998)

If you run it, run the 1996 version which is properly tempo synced.

The 1996 version required a Gravis UltraSound and was perfectly synced.

The 1998 version was a re-release with a different sound player supporting the increasingly more widespread SoundBlaster, but it introduced bugs in sound sync.
